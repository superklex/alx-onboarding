This program would read in three numbers and write them all in sorted order

user inputs three numbers a, b, c

initialize an empty array named "order"

if a is less than b and c
    Add a to the array as the first element
    if b is less than c
        Add b to the array as the second element
        Add C to the array as the third element
    else
        Add C to the array as the second element
        Add b to the array as the third element

else if b is less than a and c
    Add b to the array as the first element
    if a is less than c
        Add a to the array as the second element
        Add C to the array as the third element
    else
        Add C to the array as the second element
        Add a to the array as the third element

else if c is less than a and b
    Add c to the array as the first element
    if a is less than b
        Add a to the array as the second element
        Add b to the array as the third element
    else
        Add b to the array as the second element
        Add a to the array as the third element
Break
